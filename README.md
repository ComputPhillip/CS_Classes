### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  To understand what users need, I think about what they are trying to do and what problems they want solved. I focus on their goals instead of jumping straight into code. User stories help because they describe features in plain language from the user’s perspective. This keeps the work focused on real needs, not just technical ideas. They also make big tasks easier to break into smaller steps that can be developed and tested one piece at a time.
### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  When developing a program, I try to build it gradually instead of all at once. Agile supports this by encouraging small, repeatable cycles of planning, building, reviewing, and improving. In the future, I plan to use Agile practices like Sprints, backlog organization, and regular feedback. These help me stay flexible and make changes when new information or ideas come up.
### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member means communicating clearly, cooperating with others, and staying dependable. It also means listening to different viewpoints and sharing responsibility for the final product. Software development works best when the team supports each other and works toward the same goal.
